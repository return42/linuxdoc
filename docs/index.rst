LinuxDoc
========

The LinuxDoc library contains sphinx-doc_ extensions and command line tools to
extract documentation from C/C++ source file comments. Even if this project
started in context of the Linux-Kernel documentation (where the name comes
from), you can use these extensions in common sphinx-doc_ projects.  If this is
unclear to you, take a look at our :ref:`Introduction <kernel-doc-intro>`.
